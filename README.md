# ai.colorpuller

Pulls out the rgb values of selected fillColor and strokeColor and prints them to a new document as a hexidecimal. This is a list of add on features:
- better text placement on page
- color "swatch" next to hex value
- divide by fill and swatch (requires refactoring of code)
- deal with gradients
- deal with opacity
- perhaps print the rgba values to document
- make it work on active document, not selected objects
